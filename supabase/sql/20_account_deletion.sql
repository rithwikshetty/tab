-- 20. Account deletion (App Store 5.1.1(v))
-- ============================================================================
-- Called by the delete-account edge function with the service role, before it
-- deletes the auth.users row via the admin API. Hard-deletes everything only
-- the user could see, anonymizes their identity in shared trips, and returns
-- receipt storage paths for the edge function to remove (storage objects
-- cannot be deleted from SQL).

returns table (receipt_path text)

  -- Trips where the user is a claimed member and nobody else ever claimed one:
  -- invisible to everyone else, so they go entirely (regardless of soft-delete
  -- state). Pending email-only people cannot see a trip.

  -- user's claimed identity rows lose the personal email; the trip-scoped
  -- display name stays as the ledger label.

  -- Ghost the profile: shared-trip ledger rows restrict-reference it, so it
  -- stays — anonymized and no longer tied to any auth identity.
